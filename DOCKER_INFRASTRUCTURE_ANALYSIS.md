✅ Multi-stage build (base → deps → builder → runner)
✅ Non-root user (medusa:medusa)
✅ Health check included (curl /health)
✅ dumb-init for signal handling
❌ Missing BuildKit cache mounts
❌ No .dockerignore optimization
```

#### Storefront (Next.js)

```dockerfile
✅ Multi-stage build (base → deps → builder → runner)
✅ Non-root user (nextjs:nextjs)
✅ Health check included (curl /api/health)
✅ dumb-init for signal handling
✅ BuildKit cache mounts (--mount=type=cache)
❌ Needs standalone build config
```

### 3. Nginx Configuration

```nginx
✅ Gzip compression enabled
✅ Rate limiting configured (10r/s API, 50r/s web)
✅ Upstream load balancing (least_conn)
✅ Security headers configured
✅ Health check endpoint (/health)
✅ Static caching (1y for assets)
❌ No SSL/TLS configuration active
❌ No HTTP/2 configuration
```

## 🚨 Identified Issues

### Critical (P0)

1. **Backend/Storefront Missing Health Checks in Dev**
   - docker-compose.dev.yml doesn't define health checks for app containers
   - Causes: Premature requests, cascading failures
   - Impact: Connection refused errors

2. **No Dependency Waiting in Dev**
   - Backend starts before Postgres is ready
   - Storefront starts before Backend is ready
   - Causes: Race conditions, startup failures

3. **Missing Resource Limits in Dev**
   - Containers can consume unlimited CPU/memory
   - Causes: Host system slowdown, OOM kills
   - Impact: Crashes, instability

### High (P1)

4. **Suboptimal Build Cache Usage**
   - Backend Dockerfile doesn't use BuildKit cache mounts
   - Rebuild times 2-3x longer than necessary
   - Impact: Developer productivity, CI/CD time

5. **No Logging Configuration in Dev**
   - Logs grow unbounded
   - Causes: Disk space issues over time
   - Impact: System slowdown, crashes

6. **Network Configuration Inconsistencies**
   - Dev uses default bridge without custom subnet
   - Prod/optimized use custom subnets
   - Causes: DNS resolution issues, port conflicts

### Medium (P2)

7. **No Volume Backup Strategy**
   - PostgreSQL data not backed up
   - Risk: Data loss on container removal

8. **SSL/TLS Not Configured**
   - Nginx only listens on port 80
   - Risk: Security vulnerability in production

## 🎯 Improvement Plan

### Phase 1: Immediate Fixes (P0) - Docker Compose Dev Enhancement

**Goal:** Fix connection stability issues in development environment

#### Changes to `docker-compose.dev.yml`

1. **Add Backend Health Check**

```yaml
backend:
  healthcheck:
    test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:9000/health"]
    interval: 10s
    timeout: 5s
    retries: 5
    start_period: 40s
```

2. **Add Storefront Health Check**

```yaml
storefront:
  healthcheck:
    test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:3000/api/health"]
    interval: 10s
    timeout: 5s
    retries: 5
    start_period: 30s
```

3. **Fix Dependency Waiting**

```yaml
backend:
  depends_on:
    postgres:
      condition: service_healthy
    redis:
      condition: service_healthy

storefront:
  depends_on:
    backend:
      condition: service_healthy
```

4. **Add Resource Limits**

```yaml
backend:
  deploy:
    resources:
      limits:
        cpus: "1.0"
        memory: 768M
      reservations:
        cpus: "0.25"
        memory: 384M

storefront:
  deploy:
    resources:
      limits:
        cpus: "1.0"
        memory: 512M
      reservations:
        cpus: "0.25"
        memory: 256M
```

5. **Add Logging Configuration**

```yaml
backend:
  logging:
    driver: "json-file"
    options:
      max-size: "10m"
      max-file: "3"
```

6. **Enhance Network Configuration**

```yaml
networks:
  ysh-b2b-dev-network:
    driver: bridge
    ipam:
      config:
        - subnet: 172.20.0.0/16
```

### Phase 2: Build Optimization (P1) - Docker BuildKit

**Goal:** Reduce build times by 40-60%

#### Enable BuildKit (PowerShell)

```powershell
# Set environment variable
$env:DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1
$env:COMPOSE_DOCKER_CLI_BUILD=1

# Persist in PowerShell profile
Add-Content $PROFILE "`n# Docker BuildKit`n`$env:DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1`n`$env:COMPOSE_DOCKER_CLI_BUILD=1"
```

#### Optimize Backend Dockerfile

```dockerfile
# Stage 2: Dependency installer
FROM base AS deps
COPY package*.json ./

# Add BuildKit cache mount
RUN --mount=type=cache,target=/root/.npm \
    --mount=type=cache,target=/app/node_modules \
    npm ci --only=production --no-audit --no-fund && \
    npm cache clean --force
```

#### Create `.dockerignore`

```
node_modules
.next
.git
.env
*.log
dist
build
coverage
.vscode
*.md
!README.md
```

### Phase 3: Container Runtime (P1) - containerd.io

**Goal:** Improve container stability with lower-level runtime

#### Current Stack

```
Docker Desktop (Windows) → Docker Engine → containerd → runc
```

#### Recommendation

- Docker Desktop already uses containerd.io internally
- Ensure Docker Desktop is updated to latest version (4.26+)
- Consider Podman as alternative (already have podman-compose.dev.yml)

#### Verification (PowerShell)

```powershell
docker info | Select-String "containerd"
# Should show: Runtimes: runc io.containerd.runc.v2
```

### Phase 4: Production Deployment (P2) - Coolify Integration

**Goal:** Simplify production deployment with self-hosted PaaS

#### What is Coolify?

- Self-hosted Vercel/Netlify/Heroku alternative
- Docker-based deployment automation
- Built-in SSL, monitoring, backups
- One-click deploy from Git

#### Coolify Setup (Optional)

```yaml
# coolify.yml
version: "3.8"
services:
  coolify:
    image: coollabsio/coolify:latest
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
      - coolify-data:/data
    environment:
      - APP_URL=https://deploy.ysh-solar.com.br
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=secure_password
```

#### Benefits

- ✅ Automated deployments from GitHub
- ✅ Built-in SSL with Let's Encrypt
- ✅ Database backups
- ✅ Monitoring dashboard
- ✅ Zero-downtime deployments

## 🎓 Key Learnings

### Why Health Checks Matter

Without health checks, Docker Compose can't know if a service is actually ready:

- Container starts → "ready" (wrong!)
- App initializes → actually ready (right!)

### Why Resource Limits Matter

Without limits, one container can starve others:

- Backend OOM → crashes
- PostgreSQL gets killed → data loss risk
- Host system freezes → everything fails

### Why BuildKit Matters

Traditional builds are slow because they:

- Download packages every time
- Don't parallelize stages
- Don't cache effectively

BuildKit solves all three with:

- Mount caches (persist downloads)
- Parallel stage execution
- Smarter layer caching

---

## ✅ Success Criteria

### Development Environment

- [ ] Zero connection refused errors
- [ ] Automatic recovery from crashes
- [ ] Build time < 2 minutes
- [ ] Memory usage < 3GB
- [ ] 99.9% uptime over 7 days

### Production Environment

- [ ] SSL/TLS configured

**End of Analysis**

**Recommendation:** Start with Phase 1 (Enhanced Dev Compose) today. This will immediately fix connection stability issues with minimal risk.

**Time Estimate:**

- Phase 1: 30 minutes implementation + 1 hour testing
- Phase 2: 1 hour setup + testing
- Phase 3: Already using containerd (verify only)
- Phase 4: 4 hours evaluation + setup (optional)

**Risk Assessment:** LOW - All changes are additive and non-breaking. Backup files will be created before any modifications.
